# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to design, develop, maintain, evaluate and test software for scalable solutions. 
Software Engineering is important as it provides a systematic approach to software development, it produces software that is reliable, efficient and allows the expansion of growth with various updates. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The milestones include 
-early days of comuputing: in this stage, software was seen as an art. It became more complex as problems arose leading to recognition of the birth of software engineering as a distinct field. 
- Structured Programming : this era saw the rise of programming, Software became easier to understand, debubg and maintain
- Object-oriented programming: this revolutionised software development to allow more modular and reusable code, making it easier to manage complex systems. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software Development cycle is a process that outlines the steps thaat are involved in developing software from initial concept to maintainance. 
The phases include:
1. Planning- Defining the project's scope, goals and feasibility
2. Requirements Analysis - focuses on gathering and documenting the detailed requirements of the software
3. Design- the software's architecture and design are created
4. Coding- this is where the actual software code 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
